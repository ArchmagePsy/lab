# lab
An in-development build system/tool that was born from the frustration of modern build tools 
and the desire to create a system that gives you the power of flexibility and utility.

## the story behind lab
So I'm working on a project. I start slave away trying to setup system after system to compile
my c code. Eventually the needless complexity and confusing errors get to me. And thus for a moment I ponder.
Why should build systems have to have more logic than the application itself? 
Why should there be so many rules and restrictions?
Why does there have to be so many layers of abstraction?
And then I thought why don't I just make that myself. A simple python package that provides a base set of tools
and leaves you with the freedom to use them as you wish. Short, simple, and extensible.
